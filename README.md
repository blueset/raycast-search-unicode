# Search Unicode

Search Unicode is a Raycast extension to lookup and reverse lookup Unicode characters with their names. This is a port of [Search Unicode for Alfred] workflows and [Search Unicode for Flow Launcher] plugin.

## Usage

### Search character by description

In “Search Unicode”, type your query (ex. `subscript`) to get a list of characters
matching the keyword.

Press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to paste the character to your active input (ex. `₀`), press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Enter</kbd> (or <kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>Enter</kbd>) to copy the character. Press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>D</kbd> (or <kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>D</kbd>) to see more information about the character.

### Search character by code point

Type a sequence of hexadecimal codepoints (ex. `ff10 fffd`) to look up characters by their codepoints.

### Identify characters in a string

In “Identify Unicode”, type any string (ex. `( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)`) to identify characters in a string.

Press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to show details about the character, or press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Enter</kbd> (or <kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>Enter</kbd>) to have details shown in a side bar.

### Footnotes

Search emoji is omitted in this plugin as Raycast has built-in emoji search.

## Options

### Plugin-wide options

#### Choose executables

You can choose to use one of the following options to run the `uni` executable:

- **WebAssembly (WASM)** (default on macOS): This option uses a WebAssembly version of `uni` bundled with the plugin. This option does not require any installation, but may be slower than the native version.
- **Bundled Native** (default on Windows): This option uses a native version of `uni` bundled with the plugin. This option does not require any installation, and is faster than the WASM version. However, it might not work on macOS due to developer certificate issues.
- **System Installed**: This option uses a system-installed version of `uni`. You need to install `uni` manually using a package manager like Homebrew (macOS) or Scoop/Chocolatey (Windows).
- **Custom Path**: This option allows you to specify a custom path to the `uni` executable.

#### Maximum number of results

You can set the maximum number of results to be returned by the plugin. The default is 100.

#### Maximum number of results

You can set the maximum number of results to be returned by the plugin. The default is 100.

### “Identify Unicode” options

- **Show Encodings**: When enabled, character encodings (UTF-8, Hex codepoints, etc.) will be shown in the results.

## Advanced search tips

### Search by keywords

#### Search full keywords

By default, each keyword separated by spaces is treated as a separate search term, and the search returns codepoints that match all the specified terms.

To search for an exact phrase, enclose the phrase in double quotes (`"`).

- `"mathematical double"` will return codepoints that match the exact phrase “mathematical double”, like “MATHEMATICAL DOUBLE-STRUCK CAPITAL A”
- `mathematical double` (without quotes) will return codepoints that match both “mathematical” and “double”, like “MATHEMATICAL LEFT DOUBLE ANGLE BRACKET”

#### Search in OR mode

You can perform an OR search by beginning the search query with `-or`.

- `-or arrow star` will return codepoints that match either “arrow” or “star”.

### Search codepoints by values

#### Search by exact codepoint values

You can search for Unicode codepoints by their values in various formats    

- **Hexadecimal**:  `FFFD`, `U+FFFD`, `0xFFFD`, `%xFFFD`
- **Decimal**:  `0d65533`
- **Binary**:  `0b1111111111111101`
- **Octal**:  `0o177775`

#### Search ranges of codepoints

You can search for ranges of Unicode codepoints using two values separated by `..` or `-`

- `U+0041..U+005A`, `0x61-0x7A`, `0d48..0d57`

#### Search by UTF-8 byte sequences

You can search for codepoints by their UTF-8 byte sequences using the `utf8:` prefix followed by hexadecimal byte values.

- `utf8:EFBBBF` (for U+FEFF)
- `utf8:41` (for U+0041)

#### Combining multiple search patterns

You can combine multiple search patterns in a single query by separating them with spaces. For example:

- `U+0041 0b1100001 utf8:EFBBBF`
- `0x1F600..0x1F64F U+00A9 0d170`
